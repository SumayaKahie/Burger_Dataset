# Weekly sales trends

To analyse weekday sales trends, I aggregated total net sales by day of the week across all business dates and locations. The resulting bar chart clearly illustrates that:

- Fridays and Saturdays consistently generate the highest sales.
- Midweek days like Tuesday and Wednesday show moderate performance.
- Mondays and Sundays tend to have the lowest sales volumes.
- This insight can inform staffing, promotions, and inventory planning to align with peak business days.

## What action I suggest based on this finding.

### Optimize Staffing Schedules
Increase staff coverage on Fridays and Saturdays (both kitchen and front-of-house).
Reduce staffing levels slightly on Mondays and Sundays, when footfall is low.
Use midweek (Tues/Wed) as a training window for new hires or to schedule lighter shifts for senior staff.

### Targeted Promotions
Run value-driven promotions on low-traffic days, e.g.:
“Midweek Madness” discounts on Wednesdays
“Lazy Sunday Brunch” offers to drive Sunday interest
“Monday Burger Night” deals to increase early-week visits
Avoid heavy discounting on Fridays/Saturdays — demand is already strong.

### Menu Engineering by Day
Feature bestsellers and high-margin items on peak days (e.g., burgers, cocktails) to maximize profit.
Introduce limited-time specials midweek to create urgency and variety.

### Inventory & Prep Adjustments
Increase stock of high-demand items for Friday/Saturday (e.g., burger patties, fries, lager).
Reduce waste by scaling down prep on quieter days like Monday.
Use slower days for batch prep or testing new recipes.
